This is a simple application demonstrating a genetic algorithm for matching 2 images captured from the camera.

It owes heavily to Richard Dawkins' Weasel program (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_program)
as well as Roger Alsing's Mona Lisa (http://rogeralsing.com/2008/12/07/genetic-programming-evolution-of-mona-lisa/).

I have only tested this on an iPhone 5, so I'm not sure how the video preview and images will scale on smaller
or non-Retina displays.

I make use of Paul Solt's nice UIImage-Conversion (https://github.com/PaulSolt/UIImage-Conversion)
to get easy raw bitmap arrays and convert back to UIImages.
